These directories contain working examples of the use of pFUnit to
perform unit testing.  For each example, multiple approaches to
unit-testing are provided:

* Manual - developer manually inserts references to each test in the
  main driver.  Assertions are done with direct Fortran calls to
  pFUnit interfaces.  This approach is the most cumbersome, but also
  provides better understanding of how test assembly is managed.

* Semi-automated - developer indicates tests with semaphores in the
  source code and uses pFUnit preprocessing scripts to create a
  framework driver.  Assertions are done with macros that
  automatically track source file and line number, which improves
  clarity in several ways.  This approach reduces the effort to create
  and maintain tests but involves a bit of scripting "magic" that lies
  outside the domain of Fortran.  Real applications will likely need
  to adapt some aspects to their particular build system.

* Automated - developer places all test code in a shared object
  library (.so).  pFUnit provides a static driver that can
  automatically execute tests in such a library given a regexp that
  indicates test naming conventions.   Default is "test*".


The current examples are:

* Vanilla - a very simple example that allows users to gain some
  confidence in the utility.

* Intermediate - a more complicated example that involves multiple
  source and test files.

* Halo - a very simple example showing how to create tests for MPI based
  procedures and execute them on varying processor counts.

* Parameterized - an example showing how to create and use a
  parameterized test case.
